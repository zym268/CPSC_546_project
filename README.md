================
Yiming Zhang

This repository is for CPSC_546_project of paper A Spatial Regularized Regression Method for Basal Ganglia Division Using fMRI Signals.

The main function is [`spatial_regularized_regression.m`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zym268/CPSC_546_project/master/spatial_regularized_regression.m). The support functions in the main funtion can be found in corresponding folders.

Notice : The code could be untidy and difficult to understand, and more important, the fMRI data I use in the code is not provided, if you are interest in this algorithm or have further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me by creating a new `issue`.
